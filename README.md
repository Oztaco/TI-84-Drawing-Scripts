# TI-84-Drawing-Scripts
A collection of TI-84 scripts I've written over the years to perform drawing operations with the TI-84 graphing calculator.

These scripts automate some drawing tasks to allow you to draw more complicated calculator art, faster.

These files were transferred into the computer by hand, so you may have to transfer them to your calculator by hand. The TI-84 Connect software does not work on my machine, but if it works on yours you can use that to transfer the programs faster. If someone does this, please make a Pull Request with instructions on how to do it.

# Heads Up
If you are very new to TI-BASIC, one thing to watch out for while you transfer these to your calculator by hand is that the calculator has a variety of symbols rather than characters.

So the files in this repo may contain combinations of characters which actually translate to symbols in the calculator. Thus, whenever you see things like, `->`, `While`, `Lbl` please note that these are programming symbols in your calculator and you should NOT type them letter-by-letter.
